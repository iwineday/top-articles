    "content_en": "Earlier this week, I wrote HUMAN 3.0 – A Map To Reach The 1%.\n\nI’ve been baffled by the responses everyone has had to it. So I feel like there’s something here. Something important. In the Metatype prompt, I’ve had people respond that it brought them to tears. Crazy.\n\nI wanted to create a knowledge base for H3.0 that I could use to explore various topics and problems with AI. 30 hours of obsession later, I realized a vastly underutilized use case for AI, which is managing large swaths of knowledge that you already have.\n\nI could spend 6 months rereading books and studies to find specific quotes like a needle in a haystack, or I could retrieve the exact information I need and work magic with it.\n\nThe foundational article about HUMAN 3.0 was my own mind’s synthesis of various models I’ve studied previously, but I wanted to see all the connections.\n\nI knew there was much, much more to the model than what could fit in a nice little article.\n\nIn specific, I wanted to include:\n\n- My own personal principles that I’ve written about extensively in various books and articles, including but not limited to the digital economy\n- Daniel Schmachtenberger’s “Metacrisis” context to explain the civilizational importance of reaching your potential\n- Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi’s flow psychology and synthesis of his mentors teachings (Jung, Maslow, etc)\n- Steven Kotler’s expansion on flow psychology into neuroscience and human performance\n- The connections to various developmental psychology models throughout the entirety of H3.0\n\nNow it feels like HUMAN 3.0 is coherent, meaningful, and built on top of theories that I believe are at the leading edge of mind, body, spirit, and vocation.\n\n### Core Framework\n\nThe Four Quadrants – Life dimensions/perspectives that must all be developed:\n\n- Mind (Interior Individual): How you make sense of reality – thinking, emotions, beliefs, awareness\n- Body (Exterior Individual): How you embody potential – health, energy, movement, presence\n- Spirit (Interior Collective): How you connect and create meaning – relationships, purpose, community, transcendence\n- Vocation (Exterior Collective): How you create value and impact – career, money, systems, legacy\n\nThe Three Levels – Stages of consciousness development within each quadrant:\n\n- Level 1.0 – Conformist: External authority, rule-based thinking, security through tradition, assigned perspective\n- Level 2.0 – Individualist: Internal authority, rational thinking, security through achievement, personal perspective\n- Level 3.0 – Synthesist: Contextual wisdom, paradoxical thinking, security through acceptance, multi-perspectival\n\nThe Phase System – How transitions happen within each level:\n\n- Phase X.1 – Dissonance: Old ways stop working, restlessness emerges, feeling lost and like you don’t belong in current level\n- Phase X.2 – Uncertainty: Identity dissolves, maximum growth potential and risk, must step into the unknown or experience more pain\n- Phase X.3 – Discovery: New patterns stabilize at higher complexity, new identity starts to solidify, peak clarity and enjoyment\n\n### Key Dynamics\n\nChannels: Periods of intense, obsessive development in specific quadrants – natural acceleration periods that can compress years of growth into months.\n\nGlitches: High-risk accelerants (psychedelics, AI, life crises) that can force rapid development but require strong foundation to integrate safely.\n\nCross-Quadrant Effects: How development in one area cascades to others – both positive spirals (energy → connection → clarity → resources) and negative traps (poverty → stress → isolation → worse poverty).\n\nLifestyle Archetypes: Common patterns of imbalanced development (Workaholic, Seeker, Optimizer, Athlete, Drifter, Specialist) and their transformation paths.\n\nMetatypes: How different quadrant combinations create recognizable types (Executive, Warrior Monk, Professor, Entrepreneur, etc.)\n\n### Core Principles\n\n- Life is problem-solving – Each solution reveals new, more interesting problems\n- Integration over balance – Don’t force balance; solve problems systematically until integration emerges\n- Development is fractal – Same patterns appear at individual, relationship, organizational, and societal scales\n- Transcend and include – Higher levels don’t abandon lower capacities but integrate them\n- You can’t skip levels – Each stage provides necessary foundation for the next\n\nThe model’s power lies in its practicality: identify your core problem, determine which quadrant is the constraint, apply minimum effective development, and let solutions cascade naturally.\n\nThe goal is designing the right lifestyle – creating a life where work becomes play, health is default, relationships nourish, and meaning is abundant.\n\n## Why This Matters: The Metacrisis\n\nBefore diving into individual development, we must understand the civilizational moment we’re in. Daniel Schmachtenberger identifies our time as the “metacrisis”—not just one crisis but the interconnected web of all global crises driven by three generator functions.\n\n### Understanding Generator Functions\n\nA generator function is a deep structural pattern that creates surface-level problems. Like a mathematical function that generates a sequence of numbers, these patterns generate the crises we see. Treating symptoms without addressing generator functions is like mopping water while the faucet runs.\n\nFlow Science Validation: Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi’s research on psychic entropy provides a psychological parallel – without ordering consciousness through engaged action, chaos naturally increases. The metacrisis represents civilizational psychic entropy, where our collective attention has become disordered, creating systemic dysfunction.\n\nThe Assignment vs. Agency Crisis: Most of humanity operates on assignments—goals given by schools, employers, society—rather than self-generated purpose. This creates a civilization of low-agency individuals who perpetuate the very systems creating the metacrisis. When humans follow assignments rather than creating their own path, they become tools that can be replaced, substrate that can be consumed, and rivalrous actors competing for programmed goals.\n\n### The Three Core Generator Functions\n\n1. Rivalrous Dynamics\n\nWin-lose games where one party’s gain requires another’s loss. In rivalrous systems, actors compete for scarce resources or positions, creating destructive races.\n\nExamples:\n- Arms races: Nations spending trillions on weapons instead of healthcare because others might attack\n- Corporate competition: Companies externalizing costs (pollution, worker exploitation) to compete on price\n- Social media: Platforms competing for attention by making content more addictive, harming mental health\n- Academic publishing: Researchers hoarding data to publish first, slowing scientific progress\n\nFlow Science Insight: Research shows that flow states naturally create anti-rivalrous dynamics. When in flow, people shift from extrinsic competition to intrinsic satisfaction. Csikszentmihalyi found that cultures with more flow activities show greater cooperation and reduced zero-sum thinking.\n\nThe Self-Monetization Principle: When individuals solve their own problems and sell the solutions, they create anti-rivalrous dynamics. Your success literally depends on others’ success because you’re helping them solve problems you’ve already overcome. This “you are the niche” approach naturally evolves beyond competition.\n\n2. Substrate Consumption\n\nWhen complex systems consume the foundations they depend on faster than those foundations regenerate. The “substrate” is what something needs to exist—soil for plants, attention for media, trust for markets.\n\nExamples:\n- Industrial agriculture: Depleting topsoil that took millennia to form\n- Attention economy: Tech platforms consuming human cognitive capacity faster than it recovers\n- Financial capitalism: Extracting value from real economy faster than value is created\n- Social media: Destroying social trust and cohesion required for democracy\n\nAttention as Psychic Energy: Csikszentmihalyi’s concept of attention as “psychic energy” – the fundamental resource that shapes experience – reveals why attention economy substrate consumption is so damaging. We literally deplete our capacity to order consciousness.\n\nThe Work Evolution Solution: The progression from Job (survival mechanism) → Career (development path) → Calling (work you can’t pull away from) addresses substrate consumption by transforming work from extraction to regeneration. When work becomes calling, it generates rather than depletes energy.\n\n3. Exponential Technology\n\nTools and systems that improve themselves at accelerating rates, outpacing human wisdom and institutional adaptation. Each generation of technology enables the next, creating exponential curves.\n\nExamples:\n- AI systems: Doubling in capability every few months while regulation takes years\n- Genetic engineering: CRISPR making gene editing accessible before we understand consequences\n- Social media algorithms: Evolving faster than we can study their psychological impacts\n- Automated weapons: Removing human decision-making from life-and-death choices\n\nThe Complexity-Technology Gap: Csikszentmihalyi’s complexity theory (differentiation + integration = growth) shows why exponential technology becomes dangerous – our consciousness complexity grows linearly while technology grows exponentially, creating an ever-widening wisdom gap.\n\nWriting as Meta-Skill: In an age of exponential tech, writing becomes the fundamental human skill—it teaching how to think, how to learn, and how to earn. As AI makes technical skills commoditized, the ability to think clearly (through writing) and create coherent narratives becomes irreplaceable.",

    "title_zh": "其实，自律很简单",
    "summary": "Discipline isn't about force. It's about identity.",
    "content_en": "If you have to force yourself to do it, you will lose.\n\nThat’s what most people get wrong about discipline. They hear that word… discipline… and a montage of grueling workouts with David Goggins running and screaming starts playing in their mind. They think they need to lash themselves to do the work that leads to something good in their life.\n\n“The pain of discipline must outweigh the pain of laziness” has a lot of truth to it, as does struggle being the part of a story worth telling, but most successful people didn’t hate the entire journey. In fact, it was fun to them. They wanted to do the hard thing. And that points to a massive insight:\n\nYou are already disciplined toward the exact goals you are supposed to be.\n\nThat’s how the mind works.\n\n> Goals are conditioned into your mind by your environment\n> Your goals become your filter for reality, shaping what you focus on and what you forget\n> Your brain helps you notice and remember information that helps achieve those goals\n> Naturally, you act toward those goals and your identity solidifies\n\n### Discipline is a feature of identity\n\nSomeone who deeply identifies as a good student (after an entire childhood of their parents telling them they should pursue that goal) doesn’t have to force themselves to study for 12 hours a day. It’s just who they are.\n\nA bodybuilder who went through a breakup and was tired of having low self-confidence doesn’t struggle to eat healthy or show up to the gym every day. In fact, it is painful if they don’t. Because if they don’t, they aren’t any closer to their goal, and since that goal is so intertwined with who they are, they feel as if their survival is at stake, because it is.\n\nHumans survive on both the physical and conceptual level (genetics and memetics, we feel threatened if something important to us is threatened, no matter if it’s our pet dog or pet belief).\n\nThis is where it gets interesting.\n\nA gamer doesn’t have to force themselves to stare at the computer and perform for multiple hours at a time. Someone who loves a TV show will lie down and binge-watch the entire series. Someone who procrastinates their work – because that goal doesn’t align with them – will endlessly scroll their phone because their goal is to not achieve their goal.\n\nThese people aren’t “lazy,” they’re arguably self-disciplined, just toward a goal that results in immediate reward. That’s what discipline is, no? Persistent effort toward a goal.\n\n### Limbo is the laboratory\n\nThe reason you want to be disciplined is that you’ve exhausted your current stage of life.\n\nYou’re starting to notice that you’ve stalled out.\nYou’re starting to notice that every day is the same as the last.\nYou’re starting to notice that if you keep doing the same things, you won’t achieve the life you want.\n\nYou’re in limbo, and you don’t want to be there anymore.\n\nIt’s painful. But you misinterpret that pain and think of the first solution that comes to mind: be more disciplined. This is where most people get stuck in a loop of forcing themselves to do something they don’t want to do, just to quit two weeks later and go back to the life they swore against.\n\nPain is the signal that change is happening.\n\nThe way out is to lean in. To become aware of how painful your current life is. Because once the pain of where you are outweighs the pain of where you want to be, discipline is no longer painful, because you don’t have to force yourself to do it.\n\n### Discipline isn’t built, it’s discovered\n\nI’ve been training in the gym for about 12 years now.\nI’ve been writing every day for about 5.\nI’ve walked 10k steps every day for about 4.\n\nFor all of the above, the first time I tried to form the habit, I fell off multiple times.\n\nWhen I finally formed the habit, it was different than the other times I when I tried to force it. They weren’t “hard” to do. They were the byproduct of experimentation and discovery.\n\nAll of those habits became a part of my life for 3 specific reasons:\n\n- I was deeply aware of a painful problem in my life\n- I searched for evidence to support a desirable future version of myself\n- I changed my physical and digital environments to solidify my new identity\n\nIn middle school, my self-confidence was abysmal. I was extremely tall and lanky. I felt awkward in my own skin, so I wanted to change that. I used that pain as motivation to educate myself on fitness and nutrition.\n\nTo change my environment, every day after I got home from school, I would go straight to the computer and watch 2-3 of my favorite fitness vloggers on YouTube. They’d give me programs, exercises, and diet tips to try.\n\nI treated this as a period of discovery and experimentation.\n\nI was collecting vision. I was test-driving pieces of my future self.",

    "content_en": "If you want to be happy, be a loser. Let your parents think you’re stupid for not following their path. Start the business even when your friends don’t believe in you.\n\nBecause the Western notion of success is wrong. The life you want doesn’t lie on the other end of a degree or a high-paying job.\n\nPursuing usefulness will make you a lot happier than pursuing happiness.\n\n### The Key To Success Is Being A Useful Loser\n\nThe choice of all choices is to reject the path laid out for you at birth. To act with intention. To generate goals rather than accept them.\n\n1) Master Yourself: Self-reflection is the habit that makes all the difference.\n\n2) True Education: True education is not memorization, it’s discovery. Take matters into your own hands.\n\n3) Modern Belonging: Curate who you receive information from.\n\n4) Contribute To Society: Find the intersection of what you care about and what others care about.",
    "content_zh": "如果你想快乐，就做一个失败者。\n\n西方的成功观念是错误的。追求“有用性”比追求“幸福”更让人快乐。\n\n### 成功的关键是做一个有用的失败者\n拒绝出生时为你铺设的道路。\n\n1. 掌控自己：自我反思。\n2. 真正的教育：是发现，而非死记硬背。\n3. 现代归属感：筛选信息源。\n4. 贡献社会：找到你关心的与他人关心的交集。"

    "content_en": "The mark of a free individual is that they get what they want in life. This requires them to learn how to think.\n\nGenius-level thinking isn’t about book smarts. It’s about clarity.\n\n### This Map Of All Knowledge Is Mind-Blowing\n\nWilber found that all knowledge and experience mapped into four interconnected quadrants:\n\n- Individual Interior (Upper Left): Thoughts, emotions, beliefs.\n- Individual Exterior (Upper Right): Behaviors, actions, brain states.\n- Collective Interior (Lower Left): Culture, values.\n- Collective Exterior (Lower Right): Systems, structures.\n\nGenius thinking is a conversation that accurately covers multiple perspectives and synthesizes their best parts.\n\n### Why Smart People Are Incredibly Dumb\n\nConflict exists because people operate from different levels: Premodern (Authority), Modern (Merit/Science), Postmodern (Relativism).\n\nThe critical piece is that they cannot hold multiple perspectives. Genius thinkers reach Second-Tier thinking, where they pull truths from all prior perspectives.",
